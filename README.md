# Inelastic-DM

## The model

This is the model of dark photons $A$ coupled to a dark matter candidate $\chi$ and a heavier state $\chi'$. The interaction Lagrangian of the model is (see, e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07525)

$`\mathcal{L} = -\frac{\epsilon}{2\cos(\theta_{W})}V_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} + g_{D}V^{\mu}\bar{\chi}'\gamma_{\mu}\chi + \text{h.c.},`$

where $`V_{\mu\nu}`$ is the dark photon field strength, and $`B^{\mu\nu}`$ is the $`U(1)_{Y}`$ field strength.

The non-zero mass splitting between $`\chi,\chi'`$ allows to escape the direct detection constraints. 

The model's parameters are $`m_{V},m_{\chi}, \alpha_{D}, \epsilon, \Delta`$, where $m$ are masses, $\alpha_{D} = g_{D}^{2}/4\pi$, $\epsilon$ controls dark photon coupling to the SM, and $`\Delta = (m_{\chi'}-m_{\chi})/m_{\chi}`$. To show 2D plots with parameter space, $\alpha_{D}$, $m_{\chi}/m_{V}$, and $\Delta$ get fixed; their values are chosen in a way such that dark photon predominantly decays into $\chi\chi'$ psirs. The commonly considered choice is $\alpha_{D} = 0.1$ (subject to a simple rescale) and $m_{\chi} = m_{A}/3$. For $\Delta$, the collected curves assume $\Delta = 0.1$. Results may significantly vary depending on $\Delta$. 

The sensitivity is given in terms of $m_{\chi}$ in GeV and $\epsilon^{2}$.
 
 
## Added sensitivities

- Belle II: sensitivity to the mono-photon signature from  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03176; sensitivity to the displace signature cannot be taken as it has been computed for a somewhat different definition of $g_{D}$.
- SHiP: taken from the ESPP submission https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06692.
- FASER and FASER2: generated by FPF representatives Felix Kling and Roshan Mammen Abraham. Note that the sensitivity from the ESPP submission https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19010 is obtained for a different value of $`\Delta`$.

 
## Sensitivities to be added

- NA64: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1439855/abstracts/190820/attachments/19666/NA64_Input_to_ESPPU__2025.pdf. However, it has to be checked if their results (shown for $`\Delta = 0.4`$) may be used for the $\Delta = 0.1$ case; collaboration representatives have been contacted.

- NA62: contacted collaboration members.
