# Inelastic-DM

## The model

This is the model of dark photons $A$ coupled to a dark matter candidate $\chi$ and a heavier state $\chi'$. The interaction Lagrangian of the model is (see, e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07525)

$`\mathcal{L} = -\frac{\epsilon}{2\cos(\theta_{W})}V_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} + g_{D}V^{\mu}\bar{\chi}'\gamma_{\mu}\chi + \text{h.c.},`$

where $`V_{\mu\nu}`$ is the dark photon field strength, and $`B^{\mu\nu}`$ is the $`U(1)_{Y}`$ field strength.

The non-zero mass splitting between $`\chi,\chi'`$ allows to escape the direct detection constraints. The main signatures are "invisible" events like $`e^{+}e^{-}\to \gamma+\text{inv}`$ at Belle II and displaced decays $`\chi' \to \chi + \text{SM}`$ at beam dump and collider-based experiments.

The model's parameters are $`m_{V},m_{\chi}, \alpha_{D}, \epsilon, \Delta`$, where $`\alpha_{D} = g_{D}^{2}/4\pi`$ and $`\Delta = (m_{\chi'}-m_{\chi})/m_{\chi}`$. To show 2D plots with parameter space, $`\alpha_{D}`$, $`m_{\chi}/m_{V}`$, and $`\Delta`$ are fixed; their values are chosen in a way such that dark photon predominantly decays into a $`\chi\chi'`$ pair. The commonly considered choice is $`\alpha_{D} = 0.1`$ (subject to a simple rescale) and $`m_{\chi} = m_{A}/3`$. For $`\Delta`$, the collected curves assume $`\Delta = 0.1`$. 

For the beam-dump and collider-based experiments, results may significantly vary depending on $`\Delta`$ (as the decay width of $`\chi'`$ scales with $`\Delta^{5}`$). 

The sensitivity is given in terms of $`m_{\chi}`$ in GeV and $`\epsilon^{2}`$.
 
 
## Added sensitivities

- Belle II ($`\mathcal{L} = 50\text{ ab}^{-1}`$): sensitivity to the mono-photon signature from  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03176; sensitivity to the displace signature cannot be taken as it has been computed for a somewhat different definition of $g_{D}$.
- SHiP ($`6\cdot 10^{20}`$ PoT): taken from the ESPP submission https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06692.
- FASER ($`\mathcal{L} = 180 \text{ fb}^{-1}`$) and FASER2: generated by FPF representatives Felix Kling and Roshan Mammen Abraham. Note that the sensitivity from the ESPP submission https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19010 is obtained for a different value of $`\Delta`$.
- DarkQuest: Phase-I ($`10^18`$ PoT) and Phase-II ($`10^20`$ PoT) taken from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.08322.

## Added constraints

- NuCal, CHARM, BEBC, NA62-dump: generated using the approach of Ref. https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08081 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06828.
- Electron beam dump experiments, BaBar, scattering signatures: taken from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07525, 1911.03176.
- Merged constraints are also present.
 
## Sensitivities to be added

- NA64: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1439855/abstracts/190820/attachments/19666/NA64_Input_to_ESPPU__2025.pdf. However, it has to be checked if their results (shown for $`\Delta = 0.4`$) may be used for the $\Delta = 0.1$ case; collaboration representatives have been contacted. Update: Paolo Crivelli will send the proper curve soon.
- LHC-timing: estimate taken from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01879.
- NA62: contacted collaboration members.
